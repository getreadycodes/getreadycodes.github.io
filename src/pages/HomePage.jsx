          South Korea Wildfire Tragedy
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-2 text-lg text-black">
          Since March 21, 2025, South Korea has experienced a severe wildfire
          outbreak involving more than 20 separate blazes occurring
          simultaneously across the country. The disaster has so far killed 32
          people, including three firefighters and one government employee, and
          has led to the displacement of more than 37,000 people. The first
          significant fire occurred in Sancheong County, followed by the now
          most significant fire in Uiseong County, prompting widespread
          evacuations and mobilizing extensive firefighting resources. In
          response to the emergency, several provinces were officially
          designated as disaster zones by the national government.
          <br />
          The wildfires have been deemed the worst in South Korea's history by
          acting president <strong>Han Duck-soo</strong>.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6 text-lg text-black">
          The Sancheong County fire began on March 21, 2025, and by the evening
          of March 22 had consumed approximately 1,200 acres (490 ha) of land.
          The mountainous topography combined with strong winds and dry
          conditions significantly hampered containment efforts, with
          firefighters achieving only 35% containment despite substantial
          deployment of resources for combating the wildfire after earlier
          reaching 70% containment. Fires in North Gyeongsang Province burned
          approximately 740 acres (300 ha), while Gimhae experienced additional
          significant fires requiring evacuations. A wildfire broke out in
          Ulsan, Ulju County.
          <br />
          Additional wildfire incidents were reported across central Chungcheong
          Province and southwestern Jeolla Province, indicating the nationwide
          scope of the emergency.
          <br />
          Additional wildfires that broke out simultaneously have affected
          multiple regions throughout central and southern South Korea. The
          Korea Forest Service issued its highest-level "severe" fire warnings
          for 12 locations, including Daejeon, Busan, and the North and South
          Gyeongsang Provinces. The alert was later issued for the whole
          country.

              At 3 pm, the Seosan–Yeongdeok Expressway Jeomgok Rest Stop for the
              Yeongdeok direction was damaged by a forest fire. Prime Minister
              Han Duck-soo visited the Forest Fire Integrated Command Center and
              inspected the response situation.

              The National Fire Agency raised its fire response level to the

              was destroyed after evacuating treasures. Over 15,000 hectares

                The firefighting operation has involved nearly 1,600 personnel,
                35 helicopters, and numerous ground vehicles. Acting President
                of South Korea Choi Sang-mok directed all relevant government
                agencies to employ the maximum available resources for fire
                suppression activities. The national administration formally
                declared North and South Gyeongsang provinces and Ulsan as

                support measures.

                At least 37,829 people were displaced by the incident, which
                also required residents of 15 communities in the impacted areas
                to evacuate. This includes the relocation of 500 people in
                Uiseong County, scores of Gimhae inhabitants, and 260 residents
                of Sancheong County to temporary shelters after flames damaged

          corridor that links Ulsan and Busan, the country's second-largest
          metropolitan area. Following wildfires that spread from Uiseong to
          Cheongsong County, authorities also ordered the evacuation of 2,600
